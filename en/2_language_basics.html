	<p>
		In the example in the previous chapter, we always moved the turtle 30 steps. Imagine that now you want to make the same drawing but twice as big. You would have to change that 30 to 60 in each place separately. Instead, you could create a variable: <code>
		val size = 30</code> and then use it in all places this way: <code>move(size)</code>. This way, changing the size of the drawing would only require changing only one line: writing <code>val size = 60</code> instead of <code>val size = 30</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Another way of creating a variable is: <code>var size = 30</code>, which differs from the previous one in the first word - it's <code>var</code> instead of <code>val</code>. If a variable is declared as a var, it means that it's value can change during the execution of a program:
		<pre>
var size = 20
(...)
size = 30</pre>
	This would not be possible if a variable was a val.
	</p>
	<h3>Example</h3>
	<p>
		Let's create a beginning of a square spiral. We'll start with a segment of length 20 and 90 degrees rotation and repeat that a few times, extending the length of each next segment by 20.

	<h1 class="page-heading">Conditionals</h1>
	<p>
		Sometimes we might want to perform some action depending on some condition. This is where conditional statements come in handy. In our case the simplest conditions can be based on some properties of numerical variables such as for example:
		<ul>
			<li><code>n > 5</code> - true if variable n is greater than 5</li>
			<li><code>n >= 5</code> - true if n is greater than or equals 5</li>
			<li><code>n < 5</code> - true if n is smaller than 5</li>
			<li><code>n <= 5</code> - true if n is smaller than or equals 5</li>
			<li><code>n == 5</code> - true if n equals 5</li>
			<li><code>n != 5</code> - true if n does not equal 5</li>
			<li><code>n % 2 == 0</code> - true if n is even</li>
			<li><code>n % 2 != 0</code> - true if n is odd</li>
		</ul>
		The simplest example would be if we wanted to run some code only if some condition was true.
	</p>
	<pre>
if (condition) {
    //the code here is executed only if the condition is true
}</pre>
	<p>
		We might also want to execute some other code if the condition is false. Then the code looks like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
if (condition) {
	//the code here is executed only if the condition is true
} else {
	//the code here is executed only if the condition is false
}</pre>
	<p>TODO examples</p>
	<p>
		It is also possible to depend a value assinged to a variable on some condition in a very concise way like this: <code>val s = if (n >= 0) n else -n</code>. This snippet assigns the value of n to s if n is non-negative and the opposite number (-n) if n is negative - either way, the value of s won't be negative.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will use it in the example below to create a triangle - a green one if size is greater than 30, a red one otherwise. Try changing the value of size and see the result.
