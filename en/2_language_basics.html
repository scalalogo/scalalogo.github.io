		In the example in the previous chapter, we always moved the turtle 30 steps. Imagine that now you want to make the same drawing but twice as big. You would have to change that 30 to 60 in each place separately. Instead, you could create a variable: <code>
		val size = 30</code> and then use it in all places this way: <code>move(size)</code>. This way, changing the size of the drawing would only require changing only one line: writing <code>val size = 60</code> instead of <code>val size = 30</code>.

		Another way of creating a variable is: <code>var size = 30</code>, which differs from the previous one in the first word - it's <code>var</code> instead of <code>val</code>. If a variable is declared as a var, it means that it's value can change during the execution of a program: <code>size = 30</code>. This would not be possible if a variable was a val.
