  <h1>Welcome to ScalaLogo!</h1>
  <p>
  	On this page you will learn basics of programming in a fun way. The tutorials are inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo language</a> adapted to <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. This way you can get a grasp of a modern, popular programming language by having fun creating turtle graphics!
  </p>
  <h1 class="page-heading">Overview</h1>
  <p>The tutorials are based on a mini-library written in Scala that was created to enable drawing turtle graphics in a way similar to Logo. They are enriched with live examples thanks to <a href="https://scalafiddle.io/">ScalaFiddle</a> iframes. Each fiddle has a sample of code that will be run - you can see the result right next to the code. However, nothing will happen, until you tell it to. Below the drawing plane you can see a few management buttons with which you can:
  <ul>
    <li>make the turtle move (according to the code on the left) or stop,</li>
    <li>adjust its speed,</li>
    <li>make it move one step at a time,</li>
    <li>show or hide it.</li>
  </ul>
  The code is editable. If you make any changes to it, click the <i>Run</i> button above the code and see how the turtle will move this time. You can always restore the code to its original version with the <i>Reset</i> button. (This will only revert any code changes - again, click the <i>Run</i> button to apply the changes to the application as well.)
