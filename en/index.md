# Welcome to ScalaLogo!

On this page you will learn basics of programming in a fun way. The tutorials are inspired by the [Logo language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) adapted to [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). This way you can get a grasp of a modern, popular programming language by having fun creating turtle graphics!

## Overview

The tutorials are based on a mini-library written in Scala that was created to enable drawing turtle graphics in a way similar to Logo. They are enriched with live examples thanks to [ScalaFiddles](https://scalafiddle.io/). Each fiddle has a sample of code that will be run - you can see the result right next to the code. However, nothing will happen, until you tell it to. Below the drawing plane you can see a few management buttons with which you can:

* make the turtle move (according to the code on the left) or stop,
* adjust its speed,
* make it move one step at a time,
* show or hide it.

The code is editable. If you make any changes to it, click the _Run_ button above the code and see how the turtle will move this time. You can always restore the code to its original version with the _Reset_ button. (This will only revert any code changes - again, click the _Run_ button to apply the changes to the application as well.)
