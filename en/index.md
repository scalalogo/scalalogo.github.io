# Welcome to ScalaLogo!

On this page you will learn basics of programming in a fun way. The tutorials are inspired by the [Logo language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) adapted to [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). This way you can get a grasp of a modern, popular programming language by having fun creating turtle graphics!

## Overview

The tutorials are based on a mini-library written in Scala that was created to enable drawing turtle graphics in a way similar to Logo. They are enriched with live examples thanks to [ScalaFiddles](https://scalafiddle.io/). Each fiddle has a sample of code that will be run - you can see the result right next to the code. However, nothing will happen, until you tell it to. Below the drawing plane you can see a few management buttons with which you can:

* adjust how long it takes to make one action (in milliseconds),
* make the turtle move consecutively (according to the code on the left) or stop,
* make it perform a single action (move, rotation, etc.),
* show or hide it.

The code is editable. If you make any changes to it or just want to run it once again, click the _Run_ button above the code. You can always restore the code to its original version with the _Reset_ button. This will only revert the code changes - again, click the _Run_ button to reset the application as well.

After running the code you might get a message in English like this: "Too many actions!". This means that your code created more actions to perform than allowed. If you see it, it's possible that you have created an infinite loop or an infinite recursion (you'll learn about loops and recursion in further chapters).
