# Contribution guide

If you want to contribute by translating the tutorials to another language follow the steps below:

1. Copy a folder containing tutorials in English (or any other language you know) to a folder named with a code of the language you want to translate to (like "en" for English).
2. Add an item to the list in _index.md_ using the name and the code of the new language.
3. Translate the tutorials, following a few rules:
    * All links should point to the sites in the same language:
         * As for relative links, replace the code of the language in the beginning of the links ("/en" if you translate from English) with the code of the language you translate to.
         * Absolute links should point to a site describing an appropriate term in a proper language. If it's possible, simply link to the same article in Wikipedia in another language. Otherwise, find a different site or add a brief description as a last resort.
    * Translate all texts except for the code fragments. Only comments should be translated in the code fragments.
